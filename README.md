## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads) (I recommend at least PHP 7.4)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seg-leonelsanches/leos-music-shop-laravel-php.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd leos-music-shop-laravel-php
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Before starting, make sure you have the corresponding Segment Source Write Key registered into your `.env` file. You can find the Segment Source Write Key in your Segment source's settings. If you don't have a `.env` file, you can create one by copying the `.env.example` file.

The line with will have the Segment Source Write Key should look like this:

```env
SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY=your-write-key-here
```

Just replace `your-write-key-here` with your actual Segment Write Key.

## Starting in Development Mode

Open two terminal windows and navigate to the project directory. In the first terminal window, run the following command to start the Laravel server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

In the second terminal window, run the following command to start the Vite server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
